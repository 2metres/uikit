## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

Use search to see if the same bug, question or suggestion has already been raised.

If you're requesting a new module, prefix the title with "new module:".

If you're filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please reference the module that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.

## Installing UI-Kit locally

If you‚Äôd like to contribute code, first, you will need to run UI-Kit locally.

üí° Building the UI-Kit is only necessary if you want to contribute to it. If you want to use the modules in your own project, install them via npm as described in [How to use](#how-to-use).

To build this project you have to install [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) globally after cloning it via `yarn global add lerna` and run:

```shell
yarn
yarn bootstrap
yarn build
```

To make changes to an existing module, cd into the folder and run the watch:

```shell
cd packages/body
yarn watch
```

To add a new module run the scaffolding helper:

```shell
npm run scaffolding
```

_‚ùó After you have filled out all the blanks and added your dependencies into your package.json make sure you run `lerna bootstrap` again._
