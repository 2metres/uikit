## Reporting Bugs, asking Questions, sending Suggestions

Use the search in [issues](https://github.com/govau/uikit/issues) to see if the same bug, question or suggestion has already been raised.

If you‚Äôre requesting a new module, prefix the title with `new module: `.

If you‚Äôre filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please reference the module that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what
happened instead. For more infos look at our [issue template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

## Installing UI-Kit locally

If you‚Äôd like to contribute code, first, you will need to run UI-Kit locally.

üí° Building the UI-Kit is only necessary if you want to contribute to it. If you want to use the modules in your own project, install them via npm as described
in [How to use](./README.md#how-to-use).

To build this project you have to install [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) globally after cloning it via `npm install -g lerna` and run:

```shell
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

To make changes to an existing module, cd into the folder and run the watch:

```shell
cd packages/body
npm run watch
```

To add a new module run the scaffolding helper:

```shell
npm run scaffolding
```

_‚ùó After you have filled out all the blanks and added your dependencies into your package.json make sure you run `lerna bootstrap` again._
